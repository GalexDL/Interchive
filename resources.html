      <h1>Creator/Tool Guide</h1>
      <p>Not all images, sounds and etc are implemented fully and will be slowly added with updates. If you would like to help contribute there will be a section discussing how you can! </p>

      <h2>Starting Out:</h2>
          Open the renpy-8.0.3-sdk folder and open renpy.exe, I recommend pinning this on to your desktop or taskbar. This is the launcher for ren’py and there's a video if you want to customize 
          it to how you like, if you wish to do so. 
          Tutorial/Question are built into ren’py and you cant remove them and aren't created by me. By default Interchive should be selected anyways. 
          Open Directory: Game opens your file explorer into the Interchive Files. Here lies all of the RPY files and Images. Don't click any py files, you will regret it.
          Edit File: Open Project should ask you to select a default code editor. I highly recommend Atom, because in my opinion it visually looks the best, but you can choose 
          at your discretion. After you select it you should see like 10 .rpy files. A few of them shouldn't matter to you for simplicity sake. 
          This should wrap up the outline of the launcher and setting up renpy
      
      <h3>Files</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center;">This is an explanation of what each .rpy file contains

      <br><br>-Screens: Mainly contains menu design elements
      <br>- Charactername: Contains character names
      <br>- Gui: Usage isn't needed
      <br>- Options: Usage isn't needed
      <br>- Script: Usage isn't needed
      <br>- Functions: Contains Animations and some other code functions
      <br>- name: Contains the function for the Prince Name
      <br>- Chapter1: Usage isn't needed
      <br>- Test: Main file for testing your story quickly
      <br>- Character: Contains all the information about Image Portraits and it's no where close to done because there are like 700 characters (help)
      <br>- Debug: Usage isn't needed
      <br>- Background: Contains background image data
      <br>- Cutscene: Contains video based Cutscene data
      </p>
      
      <h3>Lets Create:</h3>
      <p>I’ll go in depth in other sections about documentation/meaning in other sections, but let's get right 
          into it. Other sections will be important as well, this section is mainly to get the feel of it. Please 
          do reinstall or undo the rpy files after, it'll make sense during the section. Also saves work differently in 
          this developer mode since you are adding things, so don't try to make saves.</p>

      If you haven't already have your code editor open, open it and go to test.rpy
          We will be creating a test story here. I layed out some of the groundwork for a story without an intro.<br><br>
          
          Label is the name of the story, this name is used so a button can call a specific story. This is very important because
          you do not want to potentially overlap other stories, I would avoid using anything too basic for universal usage purposes. <br><br>
          
          Return will always be at the end of a script, so it can take you back to the main menu. <br><br>
          
          Now we actually begin:
          On line 9 it says <code>show prince</code>, this makes the Euden appear and you can make him disappear later in the script with <code>“hide prince”</code>.
          You can change Euden’s facial expression with <code>show prince eye_4 mouth_4</code>. All sprites have various amounts of mouths/eyes and you can
          refer to the DLPortrait Loader for reference. Also to note currently all portraits are not supported, this google sheet is my current reference for characters supported. <br><br>
          
          Before we move on, make sure in the main menu that you have selected the Euden icon and created a name. By default the name is set to “none” because there is no persistent to 
          base the name off it yet.<br>  
          Moving on to line 11 it says <code>prince “test”</code>. This makes the textbox appear with the players name and the text “test”. You can type almost anything within those quotation marks,
          except for a few things thats used for customization which I will not be discussing in this section except for two of them. These two are <code>“\n”</code> and <code>“{nw}”</code>, currently the textbox barrier
          isn't complete so \n is very useful to make words go to the next line. {nw} purpose is to make a line automatically continue, this is mainly for intros fading out. 
          Each line should contain text for one scene, so dont write an essay…<br><br>
          
          We are going to look at charactername.rpy, this file contains the names of characters. This is very important because you absolutely can not put any random name.
          You must define as stylized in this file <code>define “coding name” = Character("In game name", kind=character_base)</code>. 
          For example if I am adding the name Alex I would put <code>define alex = Character("Alex", kind=character_base)</code>. Now in test.rpy I can put <code>alex “I am here”</code> <br> <br>
